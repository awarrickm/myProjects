School and Personal projects

Hello! 
  I'm Aaron Montgomery, I'm a student at ECPI right now and am making this 
  repository to hold and show my programs I make to practice. I prefer 
  using C# for no other reason than I seem to understand it more easily 
  than Java. 

Code Groupings() {

  game 3dTicTacToe() {
    AaronThreeTic.Java
    TicBoard.Java
    }
    
    project CalculatorCS() {
      CalculatorC#.cs
    }
    
    project CalculatorJava() {
      Calc.fxml
      Calculator.java
    }
  }
